## 🚀 Deployment

The site is deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

If using GitHub Actions (recommended for private repos):

1. Push source code to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will build and deploy the site to the `gh-pages` branch
3. The site will be publicly available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

---

## 🔒 Privacy

If the source code is private but the site is public:
- All HTML/CSS/JS in the built website is publicly visible
- Source files like templates or build scripts remain private if not pushed to `gh-pages`

---

## ✏️ Customization

You can modify:
- Fonts and colors via `styles.css`
- Layouts by editing HTML files
- Content in each section directly in the corresponding HTML

This site uses lightweight HTML/CSS/JS with no external frameworks, ensuring fast load times and full control over the layout.
